Messing with Tweepy Library on Python. Program can search the user's timeline and like, comment, and retweet posts with the keywords like or give. It will also follows mentions in the tweet. 

Made two new apps to filter and stream by keyword: 'merry' and 'christmas'. The script will add 'hi' and 'bye' as a comment. A delay has been added to follow the rate limits of twitter api.
